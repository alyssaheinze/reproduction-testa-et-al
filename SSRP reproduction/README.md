# Authors: Alyssa, Johanna, Matt, Takuya

# Description: 
In this repository, we provide the reproduction materials for the paper "Getting the Message? Choice, Self-Selection, and the Efficacy of Social Movement Arguments" by Paul F. Testa, Tarah Williams, Kylee Britzman, and Matthew V. Hibbing. 

The repository is organized as follows. 

Assignments folder: we have our assignments requested by Thad and Clara.

Group reproduction folder: we have our group's reproduction attempts - both with the packages of the authors and the group's "cold" efforts.

Original reproduction package folder: we have the authors' original files uploaded with their published article, in entirety, untouched.

We have created individual branches for our own replication attempts.
